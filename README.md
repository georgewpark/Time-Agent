Time Agent is a 2D, top-down stealth game that was developed as part of my 3rd year team-based games project module at university. The game was created using Game Maker Studio 1.4 and written entirely in GML. In the game, the player takes control of a 'time agent' who is tasked with travelling through time to different periods of history to complete various objectives. All stages of the project were thoroughly documented on an [independent website](http://gl-studios.weebly.com) with a weekly blog covering the entire development process from initial concept to final release. Target platforms for the game are the PC and web browser.
